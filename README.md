# Visualizing Sorting Algorithms

> This is my attempt to visualize algorithms with ncurses.
> This will display how the array is rearranged during the sort.

## Algorithms in program
- bubble
- merge
- selection
- insertion
- quick

## Tech Used
### C
### Ncurses
### Neovim && Emacs (depends on the day :) )
